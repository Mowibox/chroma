Hello to everyone reading these few lines! Today marks the **official launch of Chroma**, and Iâ€™m thrilled to finally share this project with you.

## Who am I?

<p align="center">

    </br>

My name is [Ousmane THIONGANE](https://ousmanethiongane.framer.website/). At the time of writing, Iâ€™m an engineering student at the Ã‰cole Nationale SupÃ©rieure de l'Ã‰lectronique et ses Applications (ENSEA). During my studies, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to explore fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Computer Vision.

## Why Chroma?

Chroma a personal space where I can centralize my knowledge and keep a trace of what I learn.

But Chroma is more than just a portfolio: itâ€™s also a space for knowledge sharing. My goal is to make technical subjects that may look complex more accessible, and to open the door to curious minds eager to dive into projects combining electronics, programming, and much more.

Just like a color wheel that brings together every hue, I hope Chroma will eventually cover a broad spectrum of tech-related topics.

## What does Chroma include?

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find (or soon find) on this site:

- :question: [**Tutorials:**]({{< relref "tutorials/">}}) This section offers various tutorials related to the concepts I've explored during my academic journey.

- :eye: [**Computer Vision Courses:**]({{< relref "computer_vision/">}}) Over time, I've developed a strong interest in Computer Vision. To deepen my own understanding and structure my knowledge, I've dedicated an entire section of Chroma to this field. As an engineer, it's important to master the concepts we explore â€” but even more valuable to be able to explain them to others.

- :speech_balloon: [**A Blog Area:**]({{< relref "tutorials/">}}) This is where Iâ€™ll share updates about the website and important announcements â€” like the one you're currently reading.

## Whatâ€™s next?

I plan to regularly update the site with new content. While some topics will require a bit of prior knowledge, my goal is to eventually publish content thatâ€™s more accessible to beginners as well.

In a long term, I would also love to **make Chroma a collaborative platform:** a place where anyone can ask questions, share knowledge, or even publish their own materials.
